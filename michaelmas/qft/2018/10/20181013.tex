We previously found that we could write the field momentum operator (not the conjugate momentum!) as
$$\vec{P}=-\int \pi(x) \grad \phi(\vec{x}) d^3x = \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \vec{ p} a_{\vec p}^\dagger a_{\vec p}.$$
We could also act on our momentum eigenstates with the angular momentum operator $J^i$, and what we find is that 
$$J^i\ket{\vec{p}}=0,$$
so the scalar field theory represents a spin $0$ (scalar) boson.

In general we could imagine cooking up the multi-particle state
$$\ket{\pv_1,\pv_2,\ldots,\pv_n}=a_{\pv_1}^\dagger a_{\pv_2}^\dagger \ldots a_{\pv_n}^\dagger \ket{0}.$$
But it follows that
$$\ket{\pv, \vec{q}}=\ket{\vec{q},\vec p},$$
since the creation operators for different momenta commute. So our states are symmetric under interchange, which means these particles are bosons. The full Hilbert space is spanned by
$$\ket{0},a_{\pv}^\dagger \ket{0}, a_{\pv_1}^\dagger a_{\pv_2}^\dagger\ket{0}, \ldots$$
and this is called \term{Fock space}.

If we use the number operator
$$N\equiv \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} a_{\pv}^\dagger a_{\pv}$$
which counts the number of particles in a state, we find (exercise)
$$N\ket{\pv_1, \ldots ,\pv_n}=n \ket{\pv_1, \ldots ,\pv_n}.$$
But it's easy to check that (and you should check this using the commutation relations) $$[N,H]=0,$$
which means that the number of particles is conserved in the free theory (crucially, this is not true once we add interactions).

Let's also note that our momentum eigenstates are \emph{not} localized in space. We can describe a spatially localized state by a Fourier transform,
$$\ket{\vec x} = \int \frac{d^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} e^{-i \vec p \cdot \vec x} \ket{\vec p}.$$
More generally we describe a wavepacket partially localized in position and momentum space, e.g. by 
$$\ket{\psi} = \int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} e^{-i\vec p \cdot \vec x} \psi(\vec p)\ket{\pv}\bra{\pv}.$$
Note that neither $\ket{\vec x}$ nor $\ket{\psi}$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian like in QM.

We consider now relativistic normalization. We define the vacuum such that $\braket{0}{0}=1$, which certainly must be Lorentz invariant ($1$ is just a number). So in general 
$$\braket{\vec p}{\vec q}=\bra{0}[a_{\pv},a_{\vec q}^\dagger] \ket{0}=(2\pi)^3 \delta^3(\vec p - \vec q).$$
Is this Lorentz invariant? Under the Lorentz transformation, we have $$p^\mu \to \Lambda^\mu_\nu p^\nu \equiv {p'}^\mu.$$
We want the two states to be related by a unitary transformation so that the inner product $\braket{\vec p}{\vec q}$ is Lorentz invariant (i.e. $\braket{\vec p}{\vec q}\to \braket{\vec p'}{\vec q'}=\bra{\pv}U(\Lambda)^\dagger U(\Lambda)\ket{\vec q})=\braket{\vec p}{\vec q}$ by unitarity).

To figure this out, we'll need to look at a Lorentz invariant object, e.g. the identity operator on 1-particle states.
$$1=\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \ket{\pv}\bra{\pv}.$$
Either half of this (the $d^3p$ part and the $\ket{\pv}\bra{\pv}$ part) is not LI, but somehow the whole thing is (since it's equal to $1$).

How do we prove this? We start by claiming that
$$\int \frac{d^3p}{2E_{\pv}}$$ is Lorentz invariant. This follows because $\int d^4p$ is LI, since $\Lambda \in SO(1,3)$ (i.e. $\det \Lambda=1$) so the factor of $\det \Lambda$ we would normally pick up from doing the coordinate transformation is just 1. So the four-volume element is Lorentz invariant, $\int d^4p = \int d^4 p'$. It's also true that $p_0^2= \vec{p}^2+m^2$ is Lorentz invariant (in particular, it expresses the length of a four-vector $p_\mu p^\mu = m^2$). The solutions for $p_0$ have two branches, positive and negative:
$$p_0 = \pm \sqrt{\pv^2+m^2}.$$
But our choice of branch is also Lorentz invariant (we can't go from the positive to negative solutions via Lorentz transformation). Therefore combining the last few facts, we get
$$\int d^4 p \delta(p_0^2-\pv^2-m^2)|_{p^0 >0} = \int \left.\frac{d^3 p}{2p_0}\right|_{p_0=E_p},$$
where we have used the fact that $$\delta(g(x))=\sum_{x_i\text{ roots of g}} \frac{\delta(x-x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}.$$
(To see why this is true, consider Taylor expanding $\delta(g(x))$ around its roots to leading order.)

We make the next claim: $2E_p \delta^3(\pv - \vec q)$ is the Lorentz invariant version of a $\delta$-function. The proof is as follows:
$$\int \frac{d^3 p}{2E_p} 2E_p \delta^3(\pv - \vec q)=1.$$
But we showed that $\int d^3p/2E_p$ was Lorentz invariant and 1 is certainly Lorentz invariant, so it follows that $2E_p\delta^3(\pv-\vec q)$ is also Lorentz invariant.

We therefore learn that the correctly normalized states are
$$\ket{p}\equiv \sqrt{2E_p}\ket{\pv} = \sqrt{2 E_p}a_{\pv}^\dagger \ket{0},$$
(where $p$ is now the four-vector $p$, not the three-vector $\pv$) with the inner product
$$\braket{p}{q}=(2\pi)^3 2\sqrt{E_p E_q} \delta^3(\pv - \vec q).$$
We can then rewrite the 1-particle identity operator\footnote{To see this really is the identity, let's act on the normalized $\ket{q}$. It's basically a one-liner:
$$\int \frac{d^3p}{2E_p(2\pi)^3}\ket{p}\bra{p}\ket{q}=\int\frac{d^3p}{2E_p(2\pi)^3}\ket{p}\left[(2\pi)^3 2\sqrt{E_pE_q}\delta^3(\vec p-\vec q)\right]=\ket{q},$$ since the delta function makes the integral trivial by setting $\vec p = \vec q$.} as an integral over the normalized states,
$$1=\int \frac{d^3p}{2E_p(2\pi)^3} \ket{p}\bra{p}.$$


\subsection*{Free $\CC$ scalar field} We could also look at the free complex scalar field $\psi$, with Lagrangian
$$\cL = \p_\mu \psi^* \p^\mu \psi - \mu^2 \psi^* \psi.$$
We can compute the Euler-Lagrange equations varying $\psi,\psi^*$ separately to find
$$\p_\mu \p^\mu \psi + \mu^2 \psi=0\text{ and }\p_\mu \p^\mu \psi^*+\mu^2 \psi^*=0$$
(the second equation is simply the complex conjugate of the first).
Now we ought to write our field as a sum of two different creation and annihilation operators:
$$\psi=\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_p}} (b_{\pv} e^{i \pv \cdot \vec x} + c_{\pv}^\dagger e^{-i \pv \cdot x})$$
and similarly
$$\psi^\dagger=\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_p}} (b_{\pv}^\dagger e^{-i \pv \cdot \vec x} + c_{\pv} e^{+i \pv \cdot x})$$
so that
$$\pi(x)=\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \sqrt{\frac{E_p}{2}} (b_{\pv}^\dagger e^{-i \pv \cdot \vec x}-c_{\pv} e^{i \pv \cdot \vec x}).$$
The conjugate momentum to $\psi^\dagger$ is equivalently $\pi^\dagger$. The commutation relations are then (exercise)
$$[\psi(\vec x), \pi(\vec y)]=i\delta^3(\vec x - \vec y)$$
$$\implies [b_{\pv},b_{\vec q}^\dagger]=(2\pi)^3 \delta^3 (\pv - \vec q)=[c_{\pv},c_{\vec q}^\dagger].$$
The interpretation of these equations is that different types of particle are created by the $b_{\pv}^\dagger$ and $c_{\pv}^\dagger$ operators. They are both spin $0$ and of mass $\mu$, so we should interpret them as a particle-antiparticle pair. This doesn't work for electrons, which have spin $1/2$, but it would describe something like a charged pion.

Indeed, if we compute the conserved charges in this theory by applying Noether's theorem, we get a conserved charge of the form
$Q=i\int d^3 x \dot \psi^* \psi - \psi^* \dot \psi$ or equivalently in terms of the conjugate momentum (since $\pi = \P{\cL}{\dot \psi}=\dot \psi^*$)
$$Q=i\int d^3 x [\pi \psi - \psi^\dagger \pi^\dagger].$$
After normal ordering (exercise) one can write
$$Q=\int \frac{d^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} (c_{\pv}^\dagger c_{\pv}- b_{\pv}^\dagger b_{\pv})=N_c-N_b,$$
which shows that our conserved quantity has the interpretation of particle number (counting antiparticles as $-1$).

Since there are two real scalar fields in this theory, the Hamiltonian for this theory takes the form
$$H=\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} E_p(b_{\pv}^\dagger b_{\pv}+c_{\pv}^\dagger c_{\pv}).$$
As an exercise one can check that $[Q,H]=0$ using the commutation relations, and therefore $Q$ is conserved. This is also true in the interacting theory. $N_c,N_b$ are individually conserved in the free theory, but in the interacting theory they aren't-- instead, they can be created and destroyed in particle-antiparticle pairs so that $N_c-N_b$ is constant.
