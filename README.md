# partiii-lecture-notes-201819

If you're reading this, you've found my lecture notes for the Part III Mathematical Tripos course taught at the University of Cambridge for the academic year 2018-2019! They are based primarily on lectured material but may also draw on class handouts, example sheets, and other provided notes, as well as including hyperlinks to interesting non-course material. I will try to relegate to footnotes and clearly labeled subsections all non-lectured material for ease of studying later, but some hopefully fun tidbits may creep in.

I am primarily a physics student, so these notes will focus on the various theoretical physics courses offered in the areas of Particle Physics, Quantum Fields and Strings, Relativity and Gravitation, and the Quantum Information Theory course in Lent. n.b. the Standard Model notes were discontinued after 9 lectures, as I unfortunately could not keep up with attending six courses.

How to use these notes:
I have collected all the PDFs into a single folder for easy reference, so PDFs can be found at
pdfs/(class abbreviation)-notes-partiii.pdf

For instance, if you were looking for the QFT notes, you would go to pdfs/qft-notes-partiii.pdf. Note that PDFs now have a "Last updated" date in the header on the first page, so you can tell at a glance how recent the notes are.

Disclaimer:
These lecture notes are prepared firstly for my own reference; I make no guarantees about their completeness or utility as a study guide for people who are not me. That said, I find it useful to unpack ideas which a lecturer may explain quickly or leave as an exercise, so I have included solutions to some exercises and worked through the details of calculations outlined in lecture. I try to rephrase mathematical ideas in plain language wherever possible, though I will try to make obvious when a bit of precision is sacrificed for clarity of expression. I also emphasize that these notes are intended as a supplement to the lecture content and are not a replacement for attending class. If you stop attending class, that's on you. (And also, why would you? This course isn't exactly cheap...)

These notes are still a work in progress! As such, their content is subject to change as I type some content in advance of class or update earlier lectures with reference to later ones and vice versa. If you dislike my writing style, please feel free to check out one of the other sets of lecture notes I have hyperlinked at the beginning of each PDF. Additionally, I will not be uploading notes for the Statistical Field Theory course, as I annotated a digital copy of David Tong's official lecture notes during that class in lieu of typing my own. However, I will attempt to make the notes I do upload here as comprehensive and useful as possible.
