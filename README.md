# partiii-lecture-notes-201819

If you're reading this, you've found my lecture notes for the Part III Mathematical Tripos course taught at the University of Cambridge for the academic year 2018-2019! They are based primarily on lectured material but may also draw on class handouts, example sheets, and other provided notes, as well as including hyperlinks to interesting non-course material. I will try to relegate to footnotes all non-lectured material for ease of studying later, but some hopefully fun tidbits may creep in.

I am primarily a physics student, so these notes will focus on the various theoretical physics courses offered in the areas of Particle Physics, Quantum Fields and Strings and also Relativity and Gravitation. (Maybe Quantum Information in Lent term too-- TBD.)

How to use these notes:
(Updated November 7, 2018) I have collected all the PDFs into a single folder for easy reference! PDFs can now be found at
pdfs/(class abbreviation)-notes-partiii.pdf

For instance, if you were looking for the QFT notes, you would go to pdfs/qft-notes-partiii.pdf. Note that PDFs now have a "Last updated" date in the header on the first page, so you can tell at a glance how recent the notes are.

Disclaimer:
These lecture notes are prepared firstly for my own reference; I make no guarantees about their completeness or utility as a study guide for people who are not me. That said, I find it useful to unpack ideas which a lecturer may explain quickly or leave as an exercise, so I have included solutions to some exercises and worked through the details of calculations outlined in lecture. I also try to rephrase mathematical ideas in plain language wherever possible, though I will try to make obvious when a bit of precision is sacrificed for clarity of expression.

These notes are still a work in progress! As such, their content is subject to change as I type some content in advance of class or update earlier lectures with reference to later ones and vice versa. If you dislike my writing style, please feel free to check out one of the other sets of lecture notes I have hyperlinked at the beginning of each PDF. Additionally, I will not be uploading notes for the Statistical Field Theory course, as nothing I produce as a Master's student could ever surpass the perfection that is David Tong's own notes. However, I will attempt to make the notes I do upload here as comprehensive and useful as possible.
