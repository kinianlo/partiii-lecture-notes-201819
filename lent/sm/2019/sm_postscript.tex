As you may have noticed, the notes for this course are no longer being actively updated. Unfortunately, I have reached a point in the term where I am no longer able to continue updating the Standard Model notes, nor am I attending the lectures for the course. I will still be attending \emph{AQFT, Black Holes, Quantum Information,} and \emph{String Theory} at a minimum and I expect to continue attending \emph{Supersymmetry} through the end of the term.

If you are still in need of notes for this course, I direct you to the official course notes available \href{http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cet34/teaching/SM/stdmodel.pdf}{here} and to the undoubtedly excellent set written by Dexter Chua and uploaded to his general notes page: \url{https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/}. Best wishes to those of you still taking the course; may it be an illuminating experience, and happy studying (oxymoron as it may be).
